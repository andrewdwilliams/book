# Preface

My time on this Earth is limited. In less than one hundred years, all likelihood is that I'll be dead. I often think, I am just one man in more than seven billion. What difference could I possibly make? Well, the answer is, loads. My sole objective in life is to better the lives of others, to make their lives worth living, and perhaps inspire others to follow in my footsteps. That is, primarily, why I am involved in politics. Because I want to make other peoples lives worth living.

This book is about one sole aspect of that journey, that struggle. It is about the current efforts to revolutionise democracy, and why exactly they are so important. Because, believe me, they are. Turnout at the 2015 general election went up 1% from the 2010 general election, putting it at 66%. That is awful. That means there were 24% of people on the electoral register that did not go out and vote, or 6,000,000 people.

Why exactly is that? Why does it appear that, when politics and the part it plays in our lives is just as significant as ever, a lot of people do not vote? I would argue two reasons: quite simply, people do not trust politicians or anything they say, and also that people do not support any of the parties on offer, as they believe, and they are mostly right, that they are all the same.

I do not agree with the Labour Party, the Conservatives, UKIP, the Liberal Democrats or even the Greens. Although I do believe the Greens to be the most honest of the parties, and in most cases I fully support the work of people like Caroline Lucas, Patrick Harvie and Jenny Jones in various different legislatures. And I am not here to argue that all politicians are bad. I would even vote for some Conservative politicians, like Zac Goldsmith and Dan Hannan, because at the very least they are honest and true to their word.
